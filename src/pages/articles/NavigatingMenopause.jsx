          Menopause is a natural biological transition that every woman will experience, yet it remains one of the most misunderstood phases of life. If you're reading this, you're likely navigating these changes yourself or supporting someone who is. You're not alone‚Äîand you're in the right place.
        </p>

        <p>
          This comprehensive guide will walk you through everything you need to know about menopause: what it is, why it happens, the symptoms you might experience, and most importantly, practical solutions to help you thrive during this transition.
        </p>

            Did You Know?
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Studies show that approximately <strong>75% of women</strong> experience moderate to severe menopause symptoms, yet many suffer in silence, unaware of the effective solutions available to them.

          What is Menopause?
        </h2>

        <p>
          Menopause is the point in time when a woman's menstrual periods permanently stop, marking the end of her reproductive years. Technically, menopause is confirmed when you've gone 12 consecutive months without a period.
        </p>

        <p>
          But menopause isn't just a single moment‚Äîit's a transition that occurs in three distinct phases:
        </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-primary-600 mb-2">Perimenopause</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              The transitional period before menopause, typically beginning in your 40s (but sometimes earlier). During this phase, hormone levels fluctuate, periods become irregular, and symptoms often start to appear. This phase can last 4-8 years.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-700">
              The point when you've gone 12 months without a period, typically occurring around age 51. This marks the end of ovarian function and fertility.
            </p>
          </div>
          
          <div>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-primary-600 mb-2">Postmenopause</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              The years following menopause. Symptoms may continue for several years but typically decrease in intensity over time. This phase encompasses the rest of your life.

          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          The average age for menopause in the United States is 51, but it's completely normal for it to occur anywhere between ages 45 and 55. For most women, symptoms persist for about 7-10 years, though some experience them for longer.

          Why Does Menopause Happen?
        </h2>

        <p>
          Understanding the "why" behind menopause can help you feel more in control of what's happening in your body.
        </p>

        <p>
          Menopause occurs when your ovaries gradually stop producing estrogen and progesterone‚Äîthe hormones that regulate menstruation and support reproductive function. This decline is a natural part of aging, typically beginning in your late 30s or early 40s, but accelerating significantly in your late 40s.
        </p>

        </div>

        <p>
          This hormonal transition is completely natural‚Äîyour body has been preparing for this change since birth. Every woman is born with approximately 1-2 million eggs, and by menopause, only about 1,000 remain. It's simply your body's way of transitioning to a new phase of life.

          Taking Control of Your Menopause Journey
        </h2>

        <p>
          Here's the empowering truth: while you can't prevent menopause, you absolutely can control how you experience it.
        </p>

        <p>
          The most important thing to understand is that menopause is highly individual. What works for your friend, sister, or colleague may not work for you‚Äîand that's okay. The key is finding a personalized approach that addresses your unique symptom profile and lifestyle.
